# Sourcery for Vercel

Sourcery is an extra set of eyes on your code to cut down on bugs and security risks and keep your code clean so you can move fast.

When you integrate your GitHub repos, Vercel account, and Sourcery you’ll get an automatic code review on every new pull request in GitHub. You can make sure every new code change is checked for potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, design and architecture concerns, and code quality issues. On top of this you’ll get continuous security scanning, so you’ll be able to stay on top of any security risks.
